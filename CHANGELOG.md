# Changelog

This file covers the v0.7 line from v0.7.4. Main's `CHANGELOG.md` carries v0.8.0 onwards.

## v0.7.4 (2026-11-03)

### Added

- `icons.space` (`solar:share-circle-bold-duotone`), the suite-wide glyph for a space. Its
  paths are bundled in `icons-data.ts`, so it draws without a network request.

### Changed

- `SpaceSwitcher` shows `icons.space` on the trigger when a space is active and on each space
  row. Personal keeps `icons.userCircle`.

### Fixed

- `scripts/build-icons.ts` follows renamed Iconify aliases again (`magnifer-linear`,
  `text-linear`), ported from the v0.6 line. The existing glyphs are unchanged.
